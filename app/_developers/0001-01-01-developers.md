Iran Open Data would like to develop a community of developerswho can help with its further development. If you are a developer, there are a number of ways that you can help us, dependent on your background or interest: 

- API integration: using IOD data feeds (APIs) in the application and services that you are developing.  
- Visualisations: one of the challenges is making data come to life. Have you found a great way of displaying our data? Does it combine with other data to give a new insight? Please share them with us.
- Comments:  We need your comments on our methodology and its design and code. Please share your comments and feedback with us.
