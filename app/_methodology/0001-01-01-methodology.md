An open data platform should itself be open. A defining feature of Iran Open Data is that all of its technology processes, and the architecture of the platform are publicly available on [Github](https://github.com/iranopendata) (‘Open by Design’). The code for the site is available [here](https://github.com/iranopendata/iranopendata.github.io), and the data specification and all the information about available datasets is available [here](https://github.com/iranopendata/catalog).
