#### Who are we?
Iran Open Data is a collaborative initiative undertaken by a community of individuals and organisations. It has been designed and developed by Small Media Foundation in partnership with Development Seed. Iran Open Data would like to expand its community of members, so please get in touch if you’re interested in getting involved.


#### What is open data? 
In the simplest terms, the Open Data Institute describes open data as: ‘data that anyone can access, use and share.’ More specifically, Open Knowledge International’s Open Data Handbook notes that to be considered truly ‘open’, data should adhere to the following three core principles:

- Available and accessible, at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost.
- Reuseable and redistributional, meaning that the license should permit reuse and redistribution. 
- Open to Universal Participation, so that everyone must be able to use, re-use and re-distribute data, with no restrictions on usage


#### Why Iran Open Data?

Iranian government agencies at all levels – municipal, provincial, and national – publish an abundance of data publicly. However, more often than not this data is not readily available, or is locked away in inaccessible formats (such as images or PDF), tucked away in different sections of official websites, or is not digitised. 

Iran Open Data aims to make Iranian government data accessible by gathering it together in one place, ready-to-use and pre-converted into machine-readable formats (such as CSV and JSON). Iran Open Data will serve as an online platform that can meet the needs of researchers, journalists and Iranian citizens seeking to understand Iran better through a data driven approach. 

Availability and openness of data is one the characteristics of an accountable and responsible government. Iran Open Data also hopes to highlight the areas that Iranian authorities can increase its transparency and openness for by make more data openly available. 


#### What is our methodology?

The main feature of Iran Open Data is that its entire technology process and platform behind is publicly available on Github. The code for the site is available here, the data specification and all the information about available datasets are available here. Depending on the difficulty of gathering or clearing a particular dataset (we call it data ingest), we might develop a script. The code for all the scripts developed by us is available here. We also rely on a host of other tools to capture the datasets locked away in less accessible formats. For instance, to extract data that has been produced in PDFs we currently use Tabula, which is a manual process.   


#### How to contribute to the project?
There are different ways you can get involved in the project.
