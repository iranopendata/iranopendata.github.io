<p>Iran Open Data aspires to develop a community of developers who can help us to further expand and enhance the platform. If you are a developer, you can get in touch with us in a variety of ways, depending on your background and interests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>API integration: Use IOD data feeds (APIs) in the applications and services youâ€™re developing.</li>
  <li>Visualisations: One of the challenges we face is making our data come to life. Have you found a great way of displaying our data? Have you combined it with other data to provide new insights? Please share your work with us!</li>
  <li>Feedback:  We could use your feedback on our methodology, the design of our site, and the quality of our code. Please submit your comments through our contact form.</li>
</ul>
